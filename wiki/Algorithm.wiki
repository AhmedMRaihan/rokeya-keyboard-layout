#summary Algorithm used
== Steps of the algorithm ==
 # Select which key is pressed
 # Find the position of the key where it will be inserted
 # switch( input key )
   # case "h":
    # if ( position found in step 2 =0) break;
    # take the letter residing at input position and check pressing "h" change that letter or not. 
    # If changes then remove the letter from letter-collection and replace it with appropriate letter
   # case "delete":
   # case "backspace":
    # Update texts so that deletion or backspace yields correct result
   # default: 
    # Return corresponding letter for that key
 # Insert the letter into the position founded in step 2.
