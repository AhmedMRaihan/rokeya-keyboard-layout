This layout adapt the english letter keyboard layout as long as the adaptation doesn't deteriorate the keyboard functionality significantly.


= Keyboard Idea =

If someone wish to type words like "Holud"(হলুদ) then he/she needs to type h,o,l,u,d in English. From observation it is obvious that majority of bangla letters are common to English alphabet also. So a general approach to maintain highest similarity in English and bangla is followed here. For example, bangla letter la(ল) is placed in the same position of english letter L.

Moreover people used to type words like "Holud"(হলুদ) with "h/H" typing at first and most of the time use "H" with conjunction with some other letter to type an another letter(like: "Khata"(খাতা) typed by "K" + "h/H" to produce "Kha" (খ). So Capital H is chosen for Ha(হ) and leave small H for other letters, like kha(খ).

This layout removes such ambiguity as much as possible. For example, হ is placed in "Capital H" so that Khata"(খাতা) typed by "K" + "h/H can be performed without any ambiguity.



= Software platform =

The layout is primarily developed in javascript. It is planned to develop corresponding c/c++ and java code also so that it can be used in both web interface and desktop.
